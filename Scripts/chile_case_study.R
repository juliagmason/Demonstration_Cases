# Now we want to put the data into "long" format, where instead of one column for each species, we have a column called "species" and a column called "amount." This will make it easier to tack on nutrition data.

# Finally, we need to fix the wonky species names so they match the nutrition data names. There are fancier ways of doing this, and it might be easier to have changed the column names in the original excel! This is more labor intensive but more flexible if you eventually find species names for snapper and grouper etc.

  )
# I'm not sure about pangasius, there are 2 species in the nutrient database. Double check to see if one is more commonly cultured than the other! And you can convert the other species into latin names if you find them by adding additional clauses in the case_when command.
