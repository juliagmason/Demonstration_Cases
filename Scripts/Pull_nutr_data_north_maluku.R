# RNI data ----
# Recommended Nutrient Intakes (RNIs), set by the World Health Organization, represent daily intake values that would meet the nutrient requirements of 97.5% of the healthy population of a given age and sex. 
# We have been using RNIs for children (mean RNIs of age seven months to six years) since many of these nutrients are critical for childhood growth and development, so they represent a somewhat universal nutritionally vulnerable demographic group
# Compiled from Annex 1 of this WHO report: https://www.who.int/activities/establishing-global-nutrient-requirements
# We assumed 10% bioavailability for iron and moderate bioavailability for zinc. RNIs have not been set for Omega 3 fatty acids, so we used Adequate Intake values for ùõº-Linolenic Acid for children aged 7 months to 8 years (Institute of Medicine, 2005: https://ods.od.nih.gov/HealthInformation/nutrientrecommendations.aspx).
