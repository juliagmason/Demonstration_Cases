# Load and clean aquaculture data ----
# read in indonesia aquaculture production data
indo_aq <- read.csv ("Data/Indo_aq.csv", 
                     # skip tells R to skip the first row, which doesn't contain information
                     skip = 1,
                     # header tells R that there's a row with the names of the columns
                     header = T)

# get rid of the first row that just says 2017
indo_aq <- indo_aq[-1, ]

# rename the first column since we lost the "province" column name
colnames (indo_aq)[1] <- "Province"


# take a look at the data. This tells us that something weird happened and Snapper is being interpreted as a character vector
str(indo_aq)
indo_aq$Snapper <- as.integer (indo_aq$Snapper)


# Now we want to put the data into "long" format, where instead of one column for each species, we have a column called "species" and a column called "amount." This will make it easier to tack on nutrition data. We'll use the pivot_longer() command, which is super useful but I have to look up how to do it each time! https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/pivot_longer.html and also probably exercises in the r4ds book
indo_aq_long <- indo_aq %>%
  pivot_longer (-Province, # telling R that we want to keep the "Province" column
                names_to = "Species", 
                values_to = "Catch_tons")

head (indo_aq_long)
# should have 3 columns, Province (chr), Species (chr), and Amount (int)

# Finally, we need to fix the wonky species names so they match the nutrition data names. There are fancier ways of doing this, and it might be easier to have changed the column names in the original excel! This is more labor intensive but more flexible if you eventually find species names for snapper and grouper etc.
indo_aq_long <- indo_aq_long %>%
  mutate (Species = 
    case_when (Species == "Gourame..Osphronemus.goramy." ~ "Osphronemus goramy",
               Species == "Patin..Pangasius." ~ "Pangasius pangasius",
               Species == "Cat.fish..Clarias.batrachus." ~ "Clarias batrachus",
               Species == "Nile.Tilapia..Oreochromis.niloticus." ~ "Oreochromis niloticus",
               Species == "Common.carp..Cyprinus.carpio." ~ "Cyprinus carpio",
               TRUE ~ Species) # this tells R to leave everything else as is
  )
    # I'm not sure about pangasius, there are 2 species in the nutrient database. Double check to see if one is more commonly cultured than the other! And you can convert the other species into latin names if you find them by adding additional clauses in the case_when command.
